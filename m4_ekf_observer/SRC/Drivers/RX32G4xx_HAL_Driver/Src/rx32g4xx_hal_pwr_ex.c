  *        and the HSE oscillators are disabled. Some peripherals with the wakeup capability
  *        (I2Cx, UARTx and LPUART) can switch on the HSI to receive a frame, and switch off the HSI
  *        after receiving the frame if it is not a wakeup frame. In this case, the HSI clock is propagated
  *        only to the peripheral requesting it.
  *        SRAM1, SRAM2 and register contents are preserved.
  *        The BOR is available.
  * @note  When exiting Stop 0 mode by issuing an interrupt or a wakeup event,
  *         the HSI RC oscillator is selected as system clock if STOPWUCK bit in RCC_CFGR register
  *         is set; the HSI oscillator is selected if STOPWUCK is cleared.
  * @note  By keeping the internal regulator ON during Stop 0 mode, the consumption
  *         is higher although the startup time is reduced.
